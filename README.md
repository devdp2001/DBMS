## Project Description

### Client: Dank Threads, Inc

**Description:** 
For our project, we created a relational database administration tool for a clothing store with an online shop and physical stores. The database keeps track of information about the customers, employees, orders, products, and suppliers in separate tables. Data can be easily inserted, updated, and deleted from the databases through simple forms. The product database can be queried by product category and supplier and can update item quantity and price. This tool essentially makes it easy for anybody to manage company records without a technology background. Keeping up with day-to-day operations would be centralized in one web-based tool, and expansion of this tool into other record-keeping for the store would be easy to implement.
